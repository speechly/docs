## Building the website

This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Install a fresh version of Hugo, clone this repository and run `hugo server` and you should have the development environment ready with auto reload.

## Making changes

All content is under `/content/` in Markdown. To create a new page, create a new directory under `/content/` and create a new file `_index.md`. Next step is to add the Front matter using following structure.

```
---
title: NLU Basics
description: NLU or natural language understanding is a process of teaching computers to comperehend and understand human languages. It extracts meaning out of written texts and transforms it into structured form. 
weight: 3 
---
```

Weight defines the order of the page in the side bar navigation. Description is used in meta description and as the first paragraph. Use shortish descriptions. Title should be self-explanatory.

### Adding images

Images are added to the same directory as the `_index.md` file. You can reference the image using the following shortcode

```
{{< figure src="slu.png" title="Editing NLU model in the Speechly Dashboard" alt="Screenshot from the Speechly Dashboard SLU examples screen" >}}
```

NOTE: All images must have an alt tag.

### Adding warnings/notes

You can add warning/note boxes by using the following shortcode.

```
{{< warning title="Requires a Speechly API key" >}} Content of the warning (optional) {{</ warning >}}
```

### Adding subpages

If you want to add a subpage, create a new directory under the page directory under `/content/` and create a new `_index.md` file. 


## Commiting changes
