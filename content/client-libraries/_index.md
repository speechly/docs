Speechly offers client libraries for various platforms including web, iOS, Android, and React. If you are developing on another platform, you can either use our [API reference](/speechly-api/api-reference/) or [let us know](mailto:hello@speechly.com), and we'll help you out.

Our official client libraries make it easier to interact with the Speechly API in a conforming way, and you should always use them when possible.
