# Speechly libraries

We offer [a variety of libraries](/dev-tools/overview) for integrating Speechly to your application. Our high-level [Client libraries](/client-libraries/), available for for Web, React, iOS, and Android, are the most advanced. They make it easier to interact with the Speechly gRPC API in a conforming way, and you should use them whenever possible.

# Dashboard

The Speechly [Dashboard](/dev-tools/dashboard) is where you create, deplly and configure Speechly applications.

# Command line tool

Our [Command Line Tool](/dev-tools/command-line-client/) lets you create, deploy and configure Speechly applications from the command line. Some of our more advanced features are only available when using the Command Line Tool. Beginners should start with the Dashboard.
